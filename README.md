My solutions to problems from [Dr. Mostafa's Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit?gid=855203541#gid=855203541)
Also contains my Lua CLI helper.
The helper *helps* me by automatically creating a new directory for the problem im solving and creating a main.cpp file with a main function and a simple Makefile
It also keeps an info.txt file within the problem directory with some basic information.
